  {
    q: "What is w3xp?",
    a: "w3xp is a CLI that turns deployed smart contracts into explorer-first interfaces with typed function panels, wallet-connected writes, event feeds, and ABI references.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it support verified contracts?",
    a: "Yes. For verified contracts on supported explorers, w3xp pulls source files and natspec to enrich generated interfaces. Unverified contracts still produce a usable interface from ABI data alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I customize the generated interface?",
    a: "Yes. The output is a regular Next.js project with MDX support. Override themes, layout, or individual components in your own repository, and keep those edits across regenerations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is wallet interaction supported?",
    a: "Yes. Write functions are wired to the visitor's connected wallet via standard EVM wallet adapters. Read functions execute through the configured RPC.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which ecosystems are supported?",
    a: "Solidity and EVM chains are supported today, including Foundry and Hardhat projects. Solana, Starknet, and the Move-based chains are on the roadmap.",
  },
